## Overview

Comprehensive gap analysis comparing the `/swift` skill's analysis categories against the 320 existing Swiftiomatic rules. Since this tool targets **Swift 6.3+ / macOS 26+ only**, many modernization patterns are not just suggestions — they're the baseline expectation.

Existing rules already cover: `typed_throws`, `concurrency_modernization`, `swift62_modernization`, `observation_pitfalls`, `lock_anti_patterns`, `async_stream_safety`, `fire_and_forget_task`, `delegate_to_async_stream`, `prefer_weak_let`, `prefer_swift_testing`, `generic_consolidation`, `any_elimination`, `environment_entry`, `agent_review`, `date_for_timing`, `mutation_during_iteration`, `naming_heuristics`, `structural_duplication`, `swiftui_layout`, `redundant_view_builder`.

## High Value — Clear AST patterns, straightforward to implement

### Swift 6.3 Attribute Modernization (correctable lint rules)
- [x] **`@_cdecl` → `@c`** — `@_cdecl` is replaced by `@c` in Swift 6.3. Simple attribute name match, auto-correctable. Also flag `@c("name")` syntax for custom C names.
- [x] **`@_specialize` → `@specialize`** — No longer underscored. Simple attribute rename, auto-correctable. (`syntactic_sugar` has it in examples but doesn't check for it.)
- [x] **`import struct`/`import class`/`import func` → `::`** — Module name selectors (`ModuleA::Type`) replace verbose selective imports. Suggest `::` syntax.

### SwiftUI Superseded Patterns (suggest rules)
- [x] **`ObservableObject`/`@Published`/`@StateObject`/`@ObservedObject`/`@EnvironmentObject`** — All superseded by `@Observable` + `@State` + `@Environment`. Detect class conforming to `ObservableObject`, `@Published` properties, `@StateObject`/`@ObservedObject`/`@EnvironmentObject` wrappers. Very common in older code.
- [x] **`NavigationView` → `NavigationSplitView`/`NavigationStack`** — Direct type reference detection.
- [x] **`GeometryReader` → `Layout` protocol or `.visualEffect`** — Flag `GeometryReader` usage in SwiftUI views, suggest modern alternatives.
- [x] **`@MainActor` on `View` conformance** — Redundant since SwiftUI views are implicitly `@MainActor`. Detect `@MainActor struct Foo: View` or `@MainActor` on View body. Could be a correctable lint rule.
- [x] **`NSOpenPanel`/`NSSavePanel` → `.fileImporter`/`.fileExporter`** — Direct API reference detection. Flag in SwiftUI view files.
- [x] **Formatters in SwiftUI body** — `DateFormatter()`, `NumberFormatter()`, `MeasurementFormatter()` allocated inside `body` or view computed properties. Causes re-creation every evaluation. Suggest caching as static/shared.
- [x] **Sorting/filtering inside ForEach** — `.sorted(by:)`, `.filter { }` inside `ForEach` runs every body evaluation. Suggest precomputing.
- [x] **Unstable ForEach identity** — `id: \.self` on non-`Identifiable`/mutable types. `UUID()` created per render.
- [x] **Top-level if/else in View body** — Root-level conditional branches cause identity churn. Suggest stable root with conditional content inside.
- [x] **`withAnimation` inside `onChange`** — When view has frequent non-animated state updates, last transaction wins. Suggest `.animation(_:value:)` scoped to animating view.

### Foundation Modernization (suggest rules)
- [x] **`NSAttributedString`/`NSMutableAttributedString` → `AttributedString`** — Value type, Sendable, no bridging. Also flag `NSParagraphStyle`, `NSMutableParagraphStyle`, `enumerateAttributes(in:)`. Exception: TextKit 2 layout pipeline internals.
- [x] **`Notification.Name` + `userInfo` → `NotificationCenter.Message`** (SE-0011) — Flag `Notification.Name` definitions, `post(name:object:userInfo:)` calls with userInfo dictionaries. Suggest typed `MainActorMessage`/`AsyncMessage` structs.
- [x] **`Result<T, E>` return types → typed throws** — Functions returning `Result` that immediately switch/map can use typed throws instead. (Complements existing `typed_throws` which looks at throw statements.)

### Concurrency Modernization (suggest/lint rules)
- [x] **`Task { }` in `@MainActor` → `Task.immediate`** (SE-0472) — Detect `Task { }` init inside `@MainActor` functions/closures where body does MainActor work first. Also flag debounce patterns (`task?.cancel(); task = Task { }`). Suggest `Task.immediate`.
- [x] **`@unchecked Sendable` for metatype storage → remove** (SE-0470) — `@unchecked Sendable` on structs/classes holding `[any P.Type]` arrays where `P: Sendable`. Metatypes are now Sendable automatically.
- [x] **`nonisolated(unsafe)` that's now safe** — Values that are Sendable in Swift 6.2+ (regex, enum, struct) no longer need `nonisolated(unsafe)`. Flag and suggest removal.
- [x] **Subprocess without `teardownSequence`** — `Subprocess.run()` with default `PlatformOptions()` orphans child processes on cancellation. Flag when `teardownSequence` is empty/default.

### Testing Modernization (correctable lint rules)
- [x] **XCTest assertion → Swift Testing assertion** — Individual XCT* calls: `XCTAssertEqual` → `#expect(==)`, `XCTAssertTrue` → `#expect()`, `XCTAssertNil` → `#expect(== nil)`, `XCTAssertThrowsError` → `#expect(throws:)`, `XCTUnwrap` → `try #require()`, etc. The existing `prefer_swift_testing` only flags `XCTestCase` classes — these would flag individual assertion calls even in mixed files. Could be a separate `prefer_swift_testing_assertions` rule.
- [x] **`file: StaticString, line: UInt` → `sourceLocation: SourceLocation`** — Test helper source location parameter pattern. Detect the XCTest two-param pattern, suggest single `sourceLocation: SourceLocation = #_sourceLocation`.

---

## Medium Value — Mechanical Detection

These items have clear AST patterns detectable without SourceKit type resolution.

### Collection Type Selection (new grouped suggest rule: `collection_type_selection`)
- [x] **`Array.insert(at: 0)` / `removeFirst()` → `Deque`** — Match `FunctionCallExprSyntax` for `.insert` with literal `0` arg, and `.removeFirst()` calls. Strong syntactic signal.
- [x] **`if !x.contains(y) { x.append(y) }` → `OrderedSet`** — Match if-not-contains-then-append on same receiver in `IfExprSyntax` + `CodeBlockSyntax`.
- [x] **`.sort()` after `.append()` → `Heap`** — Sequential statements on same receiver in a `CodeBlockItemListSyntax`.

### SwiftUI View Member Ordering (new suggest rule: `swiftui_view_member_ordering`)
- [x] **View member ordering** — Classify members by attribute (`@Environment`, `@FocusState`, `@State`) and kind (`let`, `init`, `body`, func). Existing `type_contents_order` only knows UIKit lifecycle categories — has no SwiftUI-specific attribute awareness. Expected order: `@Environment`/`@FocusState` → `let` → `@State` → computed var → `init` → `body` → view builders → helpers.

### SwiftUI View Anti-Patterns (extend existing `swiftui_view_anti_patterns`)
- [x] **Image decoding in body** — `NSImage(data:)` / `UIImage(data:)` inside SwiftUI `body`. Same `bodyDepth` tracking pattern as existing formatter-in-body check.

---

## Medium Value — Heuristic Detection (not pursuing)

Reviewed 2026-04-12. None of these are feasible with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. SourceKit provides `resolveType` (cursorinfo), `expressionTypes` (all expression types), and `indexFile` (USR-based declarations/references) — but cannot determine protocol conformance, type hierarchies, or semantic property dependency chains. The `AsyncEnrichableRule` infrastructure (4 existing conformers) is proven, so the blocker is SourceKit's depth, not our pipeline.

The oad-n72 swift-syntax tooling (FixItApplier, diagnostic highlights/notes, DiagnosticCategory, incremental parsing, SwiftSyntaxBuilder, AST-level FixIt.Change) improves output and corrections but does not enable new detection capabilities.

### Needs SourceKit type resolution
- [x] ~~**Empty/single-element array to Collection param**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Would need function parameter type info (is it `some Collection` vs `[T]`?). `resolveType` gives function type but parsing param types from type strings is fragile. Even with resolution, `[]` passed to `[T]` is completely normal — false positive rate too high.
- [x] ~~**Dictionary sorted by keys → `OrderedDictionary`**~~ — **Not pursuing.** `.sorted(by:)` on Dictionary is a normal, correct operation yielding `[(key: K, value: V)]`. `OrderedDictionary` only helps when maintaining sorted order across mutations — a usage context we can't determine from a single call site.
- [x] ~~**`Set<Int>` with dense ranges → `BitSet`** / **`[Bool]` → `BitArray`**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Type annotations are syntactically visible but collection size is a runtime property. A 5-element `[Bool]` for flags is fine; a 10,000-element one for a sieve should be `BitArray`. We can't distinguish without runtime profiling.

### Needs semantic understanding
- [x] ~~**@Observable + onChange computed property**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Tracing property dependency chains (computed → stored → mutation frequency) is beyond SourceKit's capabilities entirely.
- [x] ~~**`@TaskLocal` for business logic**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Distinguishing cross-cutting concerns from business logic is a human semantic judgment with no syntactic or type-level signal.
- [x] ~~**Unnecessary ViewModels**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Determining whether a class "adds real logic" vs "just forwards" requires understanding method semantics. Too opinionated for a linter.

### Already covered by existing rules
- [x] **Generic specialization in libraries** — Covered by `inlinable_generic` rule.

---

## Lower Value — Need substantial semantic analysis (not pursuing)

- [x] ~~**Parameter pack opportunities**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Feasible as a `CollectingRule` (group functions by name, detect 3+ overloads differing only in generic arity). But this pattern is almost exclusively found in library code (SwiftUI ViewBuilder, Combine). Extremely low hit rate in app-level codebases — not worth the implementation cost.
- [x] ~~**Sequence vs Collection over-constraining**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Would need to enumerate all Collection-specific APIs (subscript, `count`, `indices`, `startIndex`/`endIndex`) vs Sequence-only APIs. Many APIs overlap, and users often choose `Collection` deliberately for multi-pass guarantees. High false positive rate.
- [x] ~~**Copy-on-write opportunities**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Needs struct size analysis + mutation frequency across the codebase. Pure runtime concern beyond static analysis.
- [x] ~~**CKSyncEngine anti-patterns**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Extremely narrow domain audience. Mechanical checks are possible (missing delegate methods, missing state persistence) but the maintenance cost isn't justified for so few users.
- [x] **Quadratic copy patterns** — Already covered by `mutation_during_iteration`.
- [x] ~~**Heap allocation for 0-1 element intermediate collections**~~ — **Not pursuing.** Whether a collection has 0-1 elements is a runtime property. The general "chained transforms → lazy" suggestion would be a different rule.

## Implementation Notes

- Attribute rules (`@_cdecl`, `@_specialize`, `@MainActor` on View) are good candidates for **correctable lint rules** since they have unambiguous fixes
- SwiftUI superseded patterns (`ObservableObject`, `NavigationView`, `GeometryReader`) should be **suggest** scope since migration involves structural changes
- Foundation type replacements (`NSAttributedString`, `Notification.Name`) should be **suggest** scope
- `Task.immediate` should probably be **suggest** since not every Task in @MainActor context benefits
- Collection type suggestions should be **suggest** scope since they add a dependency
- Each bullet above could be its own rule file or grouped into thematic rules (e.g., one `swiftui_superseded_patterns` rule covering ObservableObject/NavigationView/GeometryReader/etc.)


## Implementation Priority

1. **`collection_type_selection`** (new grouped suggest rule) — `.insert(at: 0)`/`.removeFirst()` → Deque, `if !contains then append` → OrderedSet, `.sort()` after `.append()` → Heap
2. **`swiftui_view_member_ordering`** (new suggest rule) — @Environment → let → @State → computed → init → body → view builders → helpers
3. **Image decoding in body** (extend `swiftui_view_anti_patterns`) — NSImage(data:)/UIImage(data:) inside body


## Summary of Changes

All items resolved. High Value and Medium Value (Mechanical) sections were implemented in prior sessions. Heuristic Detection and Lower Value sections reviewed 2026-04-12 and closed as not pursuing — SourceKit's type resolution depth is insufficient (no protocol conformance, type hierarchy, or dependency chain analysis), and the remaining items either flag patterns that aren't actually wrong (Dict.sorted, Sequence vs Collection), require runtime information (collection sizes, mutation frequency), target extremely narrow audiences (CKSyncEngine), or have low hit rates in app code (parameter packs).
